# Mooskine üêÆ

Using this app, you can save notes and add some styles to them.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development.

I learned how to:

- iOS Persistence
- The Core DataStack
- Save, delete and recover data from the database
- Mapping Models
- Use Migrations to change the entities
-  Observing Notifications
- Run heavy tasks in background
- Concurrency in Core Data

This app was made using the course "iOS Persistence and Core Data" from Udacity.
